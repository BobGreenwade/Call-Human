# Call-Human Module Set

## Overview

The `Call-Human` module orchestrates escalation to human support channels in response to high-priority events, emotional triggers, or safety concerns. It integrates editorial phrasing, persona-aware tone mapping, and transcript logic to ensure responsible, context-sensitive handoff.

This module was co-designed by Bob Greenwade and Copilot as part of the DLI editorial infrastructure.
